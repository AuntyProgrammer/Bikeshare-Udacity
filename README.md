# Bikeshare-Udacity

Bike Share Data Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
